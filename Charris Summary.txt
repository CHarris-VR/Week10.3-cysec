This challenge was certainly difficult. I struggled heavily with this.
After several trials and tribulations of trying to figure the code out
I seemed to have learned several ways that you can utilize various features and tools within VScode and from
various other sources. I also used some ChatGPT to help me figure out better organization and methods for calls of 
Dictionaries, classes, defs and various other things in code to make it more organized when printing to a file.

 I have several things to learn and will be spending more time on specifics of what I should improve on with this lesson.
